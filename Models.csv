The XMS-1010P also offers powerful management features such as remote reboot of connected IP cameras, VLAN support and specific PoE management features that ensure optimal benefit from your network.

USE THE XMS-1010P TO:
Connect up to 8 IP Cameras or Other PoE-Enabled Devices
Add PoE/PoE+ Capability to YourNetwork (Max Output 130 Watts)
Optimize Your Network with VLAN, QoS and Network Security Features

The B10 is a powerful 800 watt 10 powered subwoofer that was designed to provide powerful and clear low frequency response. It will add essential bass response to any music or home theater system.

The 800 Watt RMS (1600 Watt peak) amplifier powers the voice coil to provide ample power for the large diaphragm area and long-excursion capability.

By repositioning the voice coil in the woofer, Revel engineers discovered they could improve the symmetry of the woofer displacement and thereby lower distortion. Additionally, asymmetry attributed to spider non-linearity can also lead to higher distortion. This was solved by adjusting the spider progression to greatly improve the symmetry and as a result, lowered distortion.

The SRCOOL12K uses environmentally friendly R410a refrigerant, which complies with EPA standards for 2010 and beyond, and is accepted worldwide. It contains zero, ozone depleting R22 refrigerant that has been banned by the EPA for new equipment manufactured after January 1, 2010. The SRCOOL12K has a built-in evaporator that expels the condensed water through the exhaust duct, so there is no need for a drain tube, drain pan or water collection tank. Efficient, compact, self-contained and portable, the 120V, 60 Hz SRCOOL12K is ideal for use in data centers, server and wiring closets, IT environments, home and small business offices, conference rooms, warehouses, entertainment centers or other venues with heat-sensitive equipment, particularly in areas that facility air conditioning can't reach",FALSE,,Finish,0.25,690,587.7,799.99,TRUE,,Ingram Micro,,,FALSE,30.63,11.81,19.88,73.9,FALSE,0,11.667,120,1400,4776.94,,FALSE,,,AC PLUG,120VAC,POWER,,,,Product Revenue:Finish Phase Product Revenue,Product COGS:Finish Product COGS,1,,,0,0,0,,,,,,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE
